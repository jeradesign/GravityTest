This is a minimum test case based on a lunar lander game I am writing. It's built in Unity 6000.0.39, but should probably work with earlier or later versions, as I haven't done anything particularly wild. In addition to the game objects and scripts, note that I've set the gravity to y=-0.0324 in the Physics Settings for the project.

In the interest of simplicity, I've replaced the lander model with a simple cube.

## To Reproduce:
* Fire rocket engines on cube by pressing space bar.
* Stop pressing space bar after the cube has risen some.
* Watch as the cube begins to slow its ascent as gravity takes over.
* Once vertical velocity falls to 0, the cube will stay where it is, unaffected by gravity.
* Rotate the cube slightly with the ⬅️ or ➡️ keys.
* Note that gravity takes effect again and the cube begins to descend.
